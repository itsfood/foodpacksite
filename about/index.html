            <h1>about the food pack&trade;</h1>
            <p class="lead">a resource pack by itsfood</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jumbotron bg-dark">
            <h2>How it started:</h2>
            <p>I created the food pack for the community on the traves sub server over the summer of '19. It sarted as a
                simple question in <span style="color: antiquewhite"
                    title="travescord's main sub server channel">#mc-general</span>, asking "What songs would you like
                to see on the Minecraft discs instead of what they already are?" Many responses came in within the next
                hour, some where similar to eachother and others a bit more obscure. I took the most suggested songs and
                replaced all of the discs. I needed a name for this resource pack, and since it was made for the people
                of the traves sub server, it was named the traves pack (later renamed food pack to disassociate with
                traves).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jumbotron bg-dark">
            <h2>Where it went:</h2>
            <p>Obviously, it came a long ways from version 1.0. Slowly, I added more things that people suggested, and
                many things of my own. In the 2.13.0 update, I retextured bows and arrows to trumpets and notes, in
                honor of <a style="color: antiquewhite" title="See the inspiration"
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTWyosdkx44">Spooktober</a>. Before that, I created traves
                speak (now English+). This is a whole new way of experiencing Minecraft. Subtle changes to the language
                of the game,
                along with some large ones too (changing things like "Curse of Vanishing" to "Curse of a Dad getting
                Milk"), change how you view the game. When this was added, everyone fell in love with it. Since then,
                I've slowly kept adding and changing as I need to (typos if there are any, which there are without a
                doubt, and adding more tweaks to the language). The food pack will continue to grow and evolve from here
                out, for as long as I can keep up with it.</p>

        <h2>What is in this pack?</h2>
        <div class="jumbotron bg-dark">
            <h2>Textures</h2>
            <p>Various texture of the game have changed, including some entities, items, and guis. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="jumbotron bg-dark">
            <h2>Sounds</h2>
            <p>Most music files have been changed. Overworld background music is now Lo-Fi, the Nether is Metal. The
                discs are mostly Minecraft Parodies. Some sound effects have also changed. The creeper exploding sound,
                for example, has been fitted with a glorious "Awww man" before it ruins your day. The trumpet makes a
                "doot doot" sound for every shot. Clicks are now "rar". And that is just the beginning!</p>
